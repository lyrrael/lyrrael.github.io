I’m looking to change things up. Now that I’m in Seattle and settled, it’s time to start planning ahead.

This is where I’m going:

- I’m currently working on brushing up my math skills and embarking on learning Python.
- I’d like to eventually get into data science and engineering. There’s a lot of cool stuff out there, and I’d like to be involved.


This is where I’ve been:

- Graduated with a BA in history
- Studied political science at a master’s level
- Joined the Peace Corps, where I served in Chengdu, China, teaching English at Southwest University for Nationalities.
- Came back and ran the hometown newspaper for eight years.

And now it’s my time to make a change.
